NAME
  sy-init - intialize local directory and create remote Syncany repository

SYNOPSIS
  sy init [-P | --plugin=<plugin>] [-o | --plugin-option=<key=value>]
          [-E | --no-encryption] [-G | --no-compression]
          [-t | --create-target] [-a | --advanced] [-I | --no-interaction]
          [-n | --add-daemon]
            
DESCRIPTION 
  This command creates a new remote repository using the specified plugin, and
  initializes the local directory. Unless -I is set, the command is
  interactive and queries the user for input.  
                 
  Depending on the chosen plugin chosen (with -P or interactively), different
  plugin-specific options are required or optional. 
 
  Once the 'init' command was successfully executed, the initialized local 
  folder can be synced with the newly created repository. The commands 
  'up', 'down', 'watch', etc. can be used. Other clients can then be connected
  using the 'connect' command.
  
OPTIONS
  -P, --plugin=<plugin>            
    Selects a plugin to use for the repository. Local files will be synced via
    the storage specified by this plugin. Any of the following available 
    plugins can be used: %PLUGINS%
     
  -o, --plugin-option=<key=value> (multiple options possible) 
    Sets a plugin-specific setting in the form of a key/value pair. Each 
    plugin defines different mandatory and optional settings that must/can
    either be specified by this option, or interactively. All mandatory and
    optional settings can be listed using the 'plugin' command. 
    
  -E, --no-encryption              
    DO NOT USE THIS OPTION. Turns off the encryption for the newly created
    remote repository. All files are stored in plaintext. No password is
    needed for either syncany:// link, multichunk or metadata. 
    
  -G, --no-compression             
    Turns off Gzip compression for the newly created remote repository. All
    files are stored in uncompressed form. Can increase indexing performance,
    but will also increase transfer times and remote storage space.
    
  -t, --create-target              
    If not existent, creates the target path on the remote storage. If this
    option is not given, the command will fail if the target folder/path does
    not exist. 
    
  -a, --advanced                   
    Runs the interactive setup in an advanced mode, querying the user for more
    detailed encryption options. In particular, it is possible to select the
    available symmetric ciphers and modes of operation to encrypt the 
    repository with.
    
  -I, --no-interaction             
    Runs the command in a non-interactive mode. The user will not be queried 
    for any input. The command will fail if not all mandatory options are 
    given on the command line. This option can be used to automate repository
    creation.
    
  -n, --add-daemon             
    The initialized local folder is automatically added to the daemon 
    configuration for automatic synchronization if this option is used.
